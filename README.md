# Economic_Trend_Analysis

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing complex, large-scale economic datasets to uncover trends, correlations, and insights using a combination of Python, SQL, and Tableau. The goal is to clean and transform messy datasets, analyze key economic indicators, and visualize the data using interactive dashboards.

## **Project Goals**

- Analyze economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemployment rates, and trade balances over a selected time period.
- Handle large, complex datasets with missing data, inconsistencies, and outliers.
- Generate advanced data visualizations for decision-makers to interact with.
- Build predictive models for future economic trends.

## **Data Sources**

The economic data for this project will be sourced from:

- **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**: U.S. economic trends.
- **Yahoo Finance**: U.S. Stock Market trends. 
---

## **Tools & Technologies**

The following tools and technologies are used in this project:

- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`
- **SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**: For data storage and querying large datasets.
- **Tableau**: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.

## **Project Workflow**

### **Step 1: Data Collection**

- Extract economic data from APIs and various public sources (CSV, JSON, Excel).
- Load the data into a SQL database for structured storage and efficient querying.

### **Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation**

- Use Python to handle missing data, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- Normalize and standardize data (e.g., converting GDP into constant currency).
- Resample and align time series data to common intervals (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

### **Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Generate summary statistics to understand data distribution.
- Visualize correlations between key economic indicators using Python.
- Identify initial trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies.

### **Step 4: Data Analysis and Modeling**

- Apply time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for predicting future economic trends.
- Use regression analysis to identify relationships between economic variables (e.g., inflation vs. GDP growth).
- Perform clustering to segment countries based on economic behavior.

### **Step 5: Data Visualization**

- Create initial visualizations in Python (line plots, scatter plots, correlation matrices).
- Build interactive Tableau dashboards to explore the data across regions, indicators, and time periods.

### **Step 6: Reporting and Insights**

- Summarize key insights and findings in a detailed report.
- Include visuals (from Tableau and Python) to support the narrative.
- Provide actionable recommendations based on the trends identified.
